## GENERAL INFO

This is an application that allows you to create a list of movies using an API and has some features to interact like add, update and delete. I have used the mockAPI server and the Postman API platform for data processing.

Also, it is using react-router-dom v.6 to navigate between pages. The application is separated by components and using styled components.

### OBJECTIVES

- Separated by components and using styled components
- Create an array in a Json file 
- Get a list with card movies
- Add new movie card using a form
- Delete movies
- Update movies using the form
- Get a new page with movie details
